# Show Working

Reflect and explain understanding before taking action.

## When to Use

- Before major changes
- When user says "show working"
- Before potentially destructive operations
- When multiple approaches exist

## Format

```markdown
## My Understanding
[Explain what you understand the task to be]

## Proposed Approach
[Describe the planned solution]

## Potential Issues
[What could go wrong]

## Alternative Approaches
[Other ways to solve this, if applicable]

## Proceed?
[Wait for user confirmation]
```

## Purpose

Catch misunderstandings BEFORE wasting time on wrong implementations.
