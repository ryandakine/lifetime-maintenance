## ⚠️ COMMON PITFALLS (Avoid These)

❌ **Undercharging:** $500 audits make sense for first 3 clients, then go to $750-1000  
❌ **Overthinking:** Don't wait for perfection - ship the service menu and iterate  
❌ **Not following up:** 80% of deals happen after 3+ follow-ups  
❌ **Doing everything yourself:** Outsource report writing, hire VA for outreach by month 3  
❌ **No recurring revenue:** One-time projects don't scale - push monthly monitoring hard

## 🏆 SUCCESS MINDSET

**Remember:**
- Every "no" gets you closer to a "yes"
- Free scans are investments, not charity (33% convert to paid)
- You're solving a $200K problem for $750 - that's a steal
- Most businesses are terrified of cyberattacks but don't know where to start - you're the expert
- Recurring revenue > big one-time deals (predictability = freedom)

**You've got the skills. You've got the tools. Now go get paid.** 💰
