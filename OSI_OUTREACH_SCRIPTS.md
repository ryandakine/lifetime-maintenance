## 🎯 SCRIPT #1: COLD EMAIL (Local Businesses)

**Subject:** Quick question about [Business Name]'s cybersecurity

---

Hi [First Name],

I'm Ryan with On-Site Intelligence, a local cybersecurity firm here in [Your City]. I specialize in helping small businesses like [Business Type - e.g., dental offices, law firms] protect against ransomware and data breaches.

I noticed [Business Name] has an online presence / handles customer data / processes payments - which makes you a target for cybercriminals. **43% of cyberattacks hit small businesses**, and most don't have basic protections in place.

**Here's my offer:**  
I'd like to run a free security scan of your network (non-intrusive, takes about 2 hours). If I find anything concerning, I'll send you a simple 1-page report with the top 3 things to fix. No strings attached.

**Why am I doing this?**  
I'm building my client base locally, and free scans are the fastest way to show what I can do. If you like the report and want ongoing help, great. If not, at least you'll know where you stand.

**Does next Tuesday or Thursday work for a quick 15-minute call to discuss?**

Best,  
Ryan

*P.S. - Last month, a local [similar business] got hit with ransomware and paid $40K. The vulnerability? An outdated router. Would've cost $200 to fix.*

## 🎯 SCRIPT #3: LINKEDIN DM (Decision Makers)

**Subject:** Cybersecurity question for [Company Name]

---

Hi [First Name],

I saw you're the [Title] at [Company] - congrats on the growth you've had in [Industry]!

Quick question: **When was the last time someone checked your company's cybersecurity posture?**

I ask because I specialize in security for [Industry - e.g., healthcare, financial services] businesses in the [XX-XXX employee] range. Most companies your size have 5-10 critical vulnerabilities they don't even know about - and attackers know exactly how to find them.

**I'd love to offer you a complimentary security assessment.**  
It's a 2-hour scan + a plain-English report showing your top risks. No cost, no vendor pitch - just useful info.

**If you're interested, I have 2 spots open this month.**  
Would next week work for a 10-minute intro call?

## 🎯 SCRIPT #4: FOLLOW-UP (After Free Scan)

**Subject:** Your Security Scan Results - [Company Name]

---

Hi [First Name],

Thanks for letting me scan [Company Name]'s network last week. I've attached your security report.

**The good news:** You're doing better than most small businesses I see.

**The concern:** I found [X] vulnerabilities - [X] of which are critical and should be addressed ASAP.

**Here's what I recommend:**  
1️⃣ **Fix the critical issues first** (Pages 3-4 of the report). I can connect you with vendors or handle this myself - estimated cost is around $[XX].  
2️⃣ **Consider monthly monitoring** ($400/month) to catch new threats before they become problems.  
3️⃣ **Train your team** - most breaches start with a phishing email. I offer a 4-hour workshop for $1,500.

**Want to discuss this over a quick call this week?**  
I'm free [Day/Time] or [Day/Time]. Just reply with what works.

If you'd rather handle this internally, no problem - the report is yours to keep. Either way, I'm here if you need me.

## 🎯 SCRIPT #7: NETWORKING EVENT INTRODUCTION

**Elevator Pitch (30 seconds):**

"Hi, I'm Ryan with On-Site Intelligence. I help small businesses protect themselves from ransomware and data breaches. 

Most companies think cybersecurity is only for big corporations, but actually, 43% of attacks target small businesses. I offer everything from one-time security audits to ongoing monitoring - basically, I'm the affordable cybersecurity department for companies that can't justify hiring a full-time security person.

What do you do?"

---

**Follow-Up Line (If They're Interested):**

"Here's what I find with most businesses: they have 3-5 critical vulnerabilities they don't even know about - outdated software, weak passwords, ports exposed to the internet.

I offer a free security scan - takes about 2 hours, and you get a plain-English report showing what's at risk. No cost, no obligation. Want me to send you the details?"

## 🎯 SCRIPT #8: SOCIAL MEDIA POST (Educational + CTA)

**Title:** The #1 Cybersecurity Mistake Small Businesses Make

---

I've scanned 50+ small business networks in the past year. **Here's the most common vulnerability I see:**

🚨 **Exposed Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) on Port 3389**

Translation: Your company's computers are accessible from the internet with just a username and password. No firewall, no VPN, no extra security.

**Why attackers love this:**  
- It's easy to find (automated scanners check every IP)  
- Passwords can be brute-forced in hours/days  
- Once they're in, they deploy ransomware to every computer on your network

**The fix? 30 minutes of work:**  
1. Disable RDP from the internet  
2. Require VPN for remote access  
3. Enable multi-factor authentication  

**Cost: Usually $0-200**  
**Ransomware payment if you don't fix it: $40K-200K**

---

**Want to know if your business has this vulnerability?**  
I'm offering free security scans to [Your City] businesses this month.

Comment "SCAN" or DM me to get on the list. 🛡️
