## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Do I really need cybersecurity for my small business?**  
A: 43% of cyberattacks target small businesses. The average cost of a breach is $200,000. Most small businesses close within 6 months of a major breach.

**Q: What if I already have antivirus software?**  
A: Antivirus is important, but it only protects individual computers. We check your entire network, cloud services, websites, and employee practices.

**Q: How is this different from the big cybersecurity firms?**  
A: They charge $5K-50K for the same services. We use automation and military-grade open-source tools to deliver enterprise security at small business prices.

A: Yes! Most services can be delivered remotely. We serve clients nationwide.
