# PRD: OSI Intelligence Platform (OSI-IP)
# On-Site Intelligence LLC - Enterprise Cybersecurity & AI Suite

## 1. Executive Summary
The OSI Intelligence Platform is a modular, air-gapped security and AI system designed for high-sensitivity environments (Defense, Healthcare, Industrial). It consolidates offensive security (Pen Testing), passive defense (Network Monitoring), and operational intelligence (AI Cameras + Private LLMs) into a single deployed hardware ecosystem.

## 2. Core Modules

### 2.1 OSI Scout (Offensive Security)
A containerized penetration testing engine enabling standardized, repeatable assessments.
- **Discovery**: Automated Nmap/Masscan aggregation.
- **Web**: Nikto/Nuclei integration for app vulnerability scanning.
- **AI Analysis**: Local LLM (Llama3/Mistral) analysis of scan data to generate "Hacker Perspective" reports.
- **5G/GTP Audit**: Specialized mode for Private 5G networks (GTP-U/TEID checking).
- **Reporting**: Auto-generation of white-labeled PDF reports with OSI branding.

### 2.2 OSI Sentinel (Network Defense)
An AI-powered passive network monitor deployed on-premise.
- **Traffic Baseline**: Learns "normal" patterns (NetFlow/Packet Capture) over 7 days.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Alerts on new devices, unusual data volume, or unauthorized connections.
- **Threat Intel**: Local signature matching against known C2 IPs.
- **Dashboards**: Real-time Kibana/Grafana view of network health.

### 2.3 OSI Vision (Physical Intelligence)
An edge-computing video analytics layer for existing camera systems.
- **Integration**: RTSP stream ingestion from legacy NVRs.
- **AI Detection**: Local processing (YOLO/JEPA) for weapons, unauthorized access, or safety gear compliance.
- **Natural Language Search**: "Show me who entered the server room last night."
- **Privacy**: Face blurring and on-premise storage (No Cloud).

### 2.4 OSI Cortex (Private AI)
A hardened LLM deployment pipeline for secure enterprise data.
- **Air-Gapped**: Runs entirely offline on OSI Hardware (M4 Studio or GPU Cluster).
- **RAG Engine**: Indexing of client documents (PDF/Docx) for secure query.
- **Role-Based Access**: Department-level data isolation.

## 3. Deployment Architecture
- **Hardware**: Standardized "OSI Nodes" (High-performance Mini-PCs or Edge Servers) running Linux (Mint/Debian).
- **Containerization**: All modules run as Docker containers for easy update/rollback.
- **Management**: Local-first CLI with optional secure VPN backhaul for managed support.

## 4. User Experience
- **Consultant Mode**: CLI tools for OSI engineers performing audits.
- **Client Mode**: Web Dashboard (React/Django) for clients to view status, alerts, and reports.

## 5. Success Metrics
- **Speed**: Pen test reports generated in < 5 minutes after scan.
- **Accuracy**: AI analysis reduces false positives by 40% vs raw scanners.
- **Safety**: Zero data exfiltration to cloud providers.
