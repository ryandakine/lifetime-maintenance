# 🚜 CIMCO Equipment Tracker: Executive Walkthrough

**For:** Dad / Operations Manager  
**Goal:** Show how this system saves time, money, and headaches starting Day 1.

---

## 1. The "Manager's View" (Home Screen)
**"The 10-Second Morning Check"**
*   **What it is:** A dashboard showing the health of the entire yard.
*   **Why it matters:** Instead of asking "Is everything running?", you look at your phone.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **YTD Spend:** See exactly how much maintenance has cost us this year.
    *   **Upcoming Alerts:** "Forklift #4 due for service in 2 days." (Prevents breakdowns).
    *   **Language Toggle:** One click switches the entire app to Spanish for the crew.

## 2. The "Worker's View" (Equipment Page)
**"No More Clipboards"**
*   **How it works:** A worker walks up to a machine (e.g., the Shredder) and scans a QR code.
*   **Instant Info:** They see the machine's status, history, and "Health Score" immediately.
*   **The "Magic" Button:** They click **"Log Maintenance"**.

## 3. Logging Maintenance (The Game Changer)
**"If it's hard to do, they won't do it. So we made it easy."**
*   **Voice Entry:** They don't type. They tap the microphone and say: *"Replaced the hydraulic hose and topped off fluids."* The app types it for them.
*   **Safety Interlock:** They *cannot* submit the log until they check the box: **"I confirm Lock Out / Tag Out procedures were followed."** (Safety first, always).
*   **Photos:** They snap a picture of the repair right there. No more "I forgot what it looked like."

## 4. The "Future" (Mesh Network & AI)
**"Building the Foundation for Automation"**
*   **Mesh Telemetry:** We don't need expensive cellular plans. We use cheap ($30) sensors that talk to each other to track equipment location and runtime automatically.
*   **AI Health Score:** The system learns. If a machine usually breaks every 500 hours, the AI warns you at 450 hours. It predicts problems before they stop production.

## 5. Why This Wins
1.  **Accountability:** We know who did what, and when.
2.  **Compliance:** Need a maintenance report for an insurance audit? Click "Export PDF". Done.
3.  **Efficiency:** No more lost paper logs. No more "I didn't know it needed oil."

**Bottom Line:** This isn't just an app. It's a digital brain for the yard that never sleeps, never forgets, and speaks both English and Spanish.
