## The Real Talk

Dad, I need this. I just lost my job and I'm not sitting around feeling sorry for myself.

You already said you'd use this system. I've built it. It's ready.

I just need $100 to order the parts so I can install it at your yard.

Once it's working at your place, I can show other scrap yards and start landing paying customers.

**Can you help me get started?**

## If He's Still Hesitant

"Look, you need the system anyway. I'm offering to install it FREE. You're saving $800+.

All I need is $100 for the tracker parts. I'll build them, install them, and prove this works.

If you like it and want to keep it, great - you got a free system.

If you don't like it, I'll take the trackers back and sell them to another yard.

**Either way, you're helping me launch my business after losing my job. That's what dads do, right?**"
