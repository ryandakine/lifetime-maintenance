# Dad Investment Pitch - CIMCO Equipment Tracker

## The Ask
**$100 loan to buy GPS tracker parts**  
**Payback: First client payment (within 2 weeks)**

---

## What I'm Building
GPS tracking system for scrap yard heavy equipment (loaders, trucks, shredders).

**Problem**: Scrap yards lose thousands when equipment breaks down unexpectedly or goes missing on their lot.

**Solution**: My system tracks location + detects when machines are running via vibration sensors.

---

## What $100 Buys
- 2 working GPS trackers (ESP32 + GPS + accelerometer)
- Demo equipment to show scrap yards
- Materials to build 10 more once I land first client

---

## The Business Model

**Per Customer**:
- Setup fee: $800 (one-time)
- Monthly: $99/month
- GPS trackers: $35 each (I build them)

**First Client Revenue**:
- Month 1: $800 setup + $99 = $899
- Payback your $100 immediately
- My profit: $700+

**Year 1 (5 clients)**:
- Setup fees: $4,000
- Monthly (12 months): $5,940
- **Total: ~$10,000 revenue**
- Costs: ~$1,500 (trackers + hosting)
- **Net profit: $8,500**

- Use parts for other projects
- Worst case: You get $50-70 back

**What if trackers don't work?**
- I've built similar systems before
- Test extensively before customer install
- Full refund guarantee to customers

**What if I can't build them?**
- All guides written, parts list ready

## Why Now?

1. **Just lost Lifetime job** - Need income immediately

3. **Market timing** - Scrap yards struggling now (economy)
4. **Zero competition** - No one targeting this niche locally

## What You're Really Investing In

Not just $100 for parts.

**You're investing in**:
- My transition from employee → entrepreneur
- Proven technical skills (I built complex systems)
- Sales-ready product (not just an idea)
- Clear path to revenue (not theoretical)

**First client = validation**  
**5 clients = $10K/year business**  
**10 clients = Full-time income**

---

## The Call to Action

**Dad, I need $100 to order tracker parts.**

I'll pay you back from my first client (2-3 weeks max).

If you want equity instead, we can discuss terms.

But honestly, I just need the seed money to prove this works.

**Can we do this?**

## Questions You Might Ask

**Q: Why not get a regular job?**  
A: I will if this doesn't work in 30 days. But I have a 2-week window to try this first.

**Q: Why GPS trackers?**  
A: Saw the need at Lifetime - equipment going missing, maintenance chaos. Scrap yards have it 10x worse.

**Q: Can you really build these?**  
A: Yes. I have all the technical guides, component list, and past experience. This is well within my skillset.

**Q: What if you fail?**  
A: Then I learned something trying to build a business, and you're out $100. But I don't think I'll fail.

## Bottom Line

**Investment**: $100  
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks  
**Best case**: Launch successful business, pay you back $100+  
**Worst case**: Learn from attempt, you lose $50-100  
**Most likely**: Land 1-2 clients, start building recurring revenue

**This is my shot. Will you help me take it?**
