# CIMCO Demo Mode Guide 🚀

This guide explains how to use the built-in **Demo Mode** to showcase the full capabilities of the application.

## 1. Accessing Demo Controls
1. Launch the application.
2. Log in (or bypass login if using dev mode).
3. In the navigation bar, click on **"🛠️ Showcase"**.
4. Scroll down to the **"🧪 Demo Controls"** section at the bottom.

## 2. Using Demo & Clean Modes

### 🚀 Load Demo Data
Clicking this button will **WIPE** existing data and populate the database with a rich set of realistic scenarios, including:
- **Equipment**: Shredders, Conveyors, Hydraulic Units (with varying health scores).
- **Inventory**: Spare parts, consumables, and low-stock alerts.
- **Tasks**: Maintenance tickets (Pending, Complete, Critical).
- **Logs**: Simulated machine events and operator logs.

**Use this for**:
- Sales demonstrations.
- Showing the "ideal state" of the software.
- Testing UI layouts with real-world data volume.

### 🧹 Wipe / Reset Data
Clicking this button (after confirmation) will **DELETE ALL DATA**.
- It leaves a single "System Ready" entry to prevent empty-state bugs.
- Returns the app to a "Fresh Install" state.

**Use this for**:
- Handing the tablet over to a real user.
- Starting a fresh shift/deployment.

## 3. Demo Talking Points
When demoing the "Loaded" state, highlight:
- **Equipment Health**: Show the "Equipment" tab. Point out the "Down" status (Red) vs "Active" (Green).
- **Inventory Value**: Go to "Inventory". Show the Stats Cards at the top (Total Value, Critical Stock).
- **Voice Commands**: Demonstrate adding a part using the "Voice Input" in Inventory.
- **Tasks**: Show the prioritized task list.
