## 🎯 WHAT THE BANK WILL ASK YOU

**Be ready to answer these questions:**

### "What does your business do?"
**Your answer:**  
"On-Site Intelligence provides cybersecurity services to small and medium-sized businesses. We do security audits, vulnerability scanning, and managed security monitoring. Think of us as the affordable cybersecurity department for companies that can't justify a full-time security hire."

### "What's your expected monthly revenue?"
**Your answer:**  
"We're projecting $5,000-10,000 per month within the first quarter through a combination of one-time security assessments and monthly monitoring contracts. We've already generated interest from local businesses."

### "What types of transactions will you have?"
**Your answer:**  
"Primarily client payments via check, ACH transfer, and credit card (processed through Stripe or Square). Monthly recurring charges for monitoring services. Occasional vendor payments for subcontractors and tools."

### "How much will you keep in the account?"
**Your answer:**  
"Initially $500-1,000. We'll build to a $5,000-10,000 operating balance within 90 days as revenue grows."

### "Do you need merchant services (credit card processing)?"
**Your answer:**  
"Not immediately through the bank. We'll use Stripe for online payments initially, but may want to integrate bank merchant services later."
